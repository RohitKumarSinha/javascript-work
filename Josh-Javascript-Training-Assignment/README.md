Welcome to the Awesome TODO List App, a simple and elegant way to manage your tasks and stay organized. This app is built using HTML,JavaScript, and leverages the power of Bootstrap for a smooth and stylish user interface. CSS is used to enhance the user experience by providing a beautiful background image for the website. Additionally, the app utilizes local storage to ensure that your task data remains intact and doesn't fade away, even when you reload the page.

High priority tasks are displayed in red.

Normal priority tasks are displayed in blue.

Low priority tasks are displayed in green.

Task Completion: Click a task's title to mark it as completed. It will be displayed with a strikethrough effect.

Efficient Updates: This app utilizes a memoized function that returns the cached value when the same arguments are passed. This means that when you interact with your tasks, only the necessary updates are performed, resulting in a more efficient and smoother user experience.

Private Counter: The app also uses closures to create a private counter. This counter keeps track of the total number of tasks, and it's encapsulated to ensure data privacy. You can see the total number of tasks in the console.
